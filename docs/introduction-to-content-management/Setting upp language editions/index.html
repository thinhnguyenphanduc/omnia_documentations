<h1 id="setting-upp-language-editions">Setting upp Language Editions</h1>
<p>In Omnia editors can work with more than  one Language Edition of the content for a page. There's no actual settings specifically for languages in Omnia Admin, but there are some prerequisites:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Omnia Tenant Feature &quot;Omnia Intranet Multi Lingual&quot; must be active.</li>
<li>The languages to be used must be defined in the Term Store, under &quot;&quot;Working Languages&quot;.</li>
<li>If any Page Properties should be shared between languages, you must select &quot;Shared&quot; for these properties under Content Management/Page Properties in Omnia Admin.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note!</strong>
This has to do with the content of publishing pages only. Different languages for menus, labels etc are handled through System/Localization.</p>

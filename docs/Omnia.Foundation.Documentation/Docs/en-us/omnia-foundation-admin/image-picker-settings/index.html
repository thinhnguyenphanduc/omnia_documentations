<h1 id="image-picker-settings">Image Picker Settings</h1>
<p>Use this page to set which image renditions should be available in an image library, when an editor is using Quick Edit. If the library has any Managed Metadata type columns - you set which properties (metadata) should be available for filtering by the editors using the library.</p>

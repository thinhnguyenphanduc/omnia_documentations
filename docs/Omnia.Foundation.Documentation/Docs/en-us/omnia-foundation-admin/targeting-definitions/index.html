<h1 id="targeting-definitions">Targeting Definitions</h1>
<p>Omnia Targeting Definitions can be used for Banners, Important Announcements, Common Links and News.</p>
<p><strong>Note!</strong>
Targeting works a bit differently for Common Links and News and other web pages on one hand, and for Important Announcements and Banners on the other. For Important Announcements and Banners, all target definitions are available. For Common Links, News and other web pages, you have to decide which target definition to use.</p>
<p>The Targeting Definitions that should be possible to use is set up here. This will result in more or more fields to use for targeting by the editor or adminstrator creating the banner, important announcement etc.</p>
<p>There's two main approaches, either you create a Targeting Definition for a user profile and tie that definition to a term set or part of a term set (the term set must already exist). The result will be one ore more fields with where the editor can select terms for targeting. A suitable example could be if targeting should be possible to one or more countries or locations.</p>
<p>The other approach is to create target groups for example based on AD groups or óther permission groups available. If needed you can map several permission groups to form a single Target Definition.</p>

<h1 id="latest-documents">Latest Documents</h1>
<p>The Latest Documents control (also called Last Updated Documents) aggregates all documents that have been recently modified from all sites the user is following.</p>
<p>Note! The Latest Documents control is based on the search engine in SharePoint. It may take several minutes before an updated document is shown on the start page.</p>
<p>Latest Documents is often displayed in the Notification Panel, for example:</p>
<p><img src="../../Images/latestdocuments.png" alt="Latest Documents" /></p>
<p>Settings for Latest Documents in the Notification Panel is set there, see:</p>
<p><a href="/Docs/en-us/omnia-foundation-controls/notification-panel/index.html">Notification Panel</a></p>
<p>Latest Documents can also be added as a separate control. To change the settings for the separate control, activate the Edit switch and click the settings gear.</p>
<p>This will open the settings dialog.</p>

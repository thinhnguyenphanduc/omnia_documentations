<h1 id="my-tasks">My Tasks</h1>
<p>The My Tasks Control aggregates all tasks that have been assigned to the current user (from all sites, not only the ones the user is following).</p>
<p>Note!
The My Tasks Control is based on the search engine in SharePoint. It may take several minutes before a task assigned to the current user in a team site is shown on the start page.</p>
<p>All sites with tasks assigned to the user is displayed in a list, with the number of tasks assigned in each site.</p>
<p>The My taskslist is often part of the Notification panel but can also be added as a separate control, as a web part on a legacy page, or a block on a Quick Page.</p>
<h2 id="my-tasks-list-in-notification-panel">My Tasks list in Notification panel</h2>
<p>Here's an example of a My Tasks list in Notification Panel:</p>
<p><img src="../../Images/mytasks-new.png" alt="My Tasks" /></p>
<p>The user can then click a site to see more information about the tasks there, for example:</p>
<p><img src="../../Images/mytasks-clicked.png" alt="My Tasks" /></p>
<p>Settings for the control are in this case handled through the notification panel, see:</p>

<p>You can place the My Tasks control as a web part on any legacy page, or as a block on a Quick Page.</p>
<p>Here's an example when My Tasks is used on a Quick Page:</p>
<p><img src="../../Images/my-tasks-block.png" alt="My Tasks" /></p>
<p>To change the settings for the control, activate the edit switch and then click the settings gear. This will open the settings dialog.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Row Limit</strong>: The maximum number of tasks to show in the list.</li>
<li><strong>Day Limit</strong>: (No longer used).</li>
<li><strong>Custom colors</strong> You should primarily set colors through Theme colors in Omnia Admin (System/Settings/Default colors). If you still would like custom colors for the control, you can set them using this tab.</li>
</ul>

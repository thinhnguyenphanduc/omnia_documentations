<ul>
<li><strong>Site Url</strong>: Defines where to go when the user clicks on the logo image.</li>
<li><strong>Logo Image Url</strong>: Url to the logo image. Make sure all users that should be able to access to portal have read access to the image.</li>
<li><strong>Custom colors</strong>: You should primarily set colors through Theme colors in Omnia Admin (System/Settings/Default colors). If you still would like custom colors for the control, you can set color of the header area that spans the logo and search box on this tab.</li>
</ul>

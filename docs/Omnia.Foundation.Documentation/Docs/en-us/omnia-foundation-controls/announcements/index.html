<h1 id="announcements">Announcements</h1>
<p>The Announcements Control aggregates the latest non expired announcements that the user has read access to (from all sites, not only the ones the user is following).</p>
<p>Note! The Announcements Control is based on the search engine in SharePoint. It may take several minutes before an announcement created in a team site is shown on the start page.</p>
<p>Announcements is often a part of the Notification Panel, for example:</p>
<p><img src="../../Images/announcements.png" alt="Announcements" /></p>
<p>Settings for Announcements in the Notification Panel is set there, see:</p>
<p><a href="/Docs/en-us/omnia-foundation-controls/notification-panel/index.html">Notification Panel</a></p>
<p>Announcements can also be added as a separate control. To change the settings for the separate control, activate the Edit switch and click the settings gear.</p>
<p>This will open the settings dialog.</p>

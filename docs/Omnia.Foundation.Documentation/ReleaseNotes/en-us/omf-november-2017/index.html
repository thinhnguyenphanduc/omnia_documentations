<h2 id="new-features">New Features</h2>
<p><strong>Color Theme</strong></p>
<p>The Default Colors feature in Omnia Admin has been updated to support a Color Theme that will be applied to all components in Omnia. The previous user interface has been replaced and merge with the new one. The color theme consists of a Primary Color, an Accent Color and a color scale from Dark to Light.</p>

<p>The color set as Background Color in the previous version of Omnia, will be migrated to the Primary color. All other colors in the theme will use a grayscale by default and can be changed according to requirements. Any color set on existing components in Omnia will be kept for backward compatibility, but if possible, it is recommended to only change the theme. Colors on component level have been moved to a new tab called &quot;Custom Colors&quot;.</p>

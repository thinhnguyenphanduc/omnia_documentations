<p>It is also possible to create a new type of tutorial type, a wizard. A wizard tutorial can be used to
give an introduction to a specific part of the solution without connecting it to certain parts
of the page. The wizard will show up in the middle of the page.</p>

<p>The predefined filter can be used to set the scope of the directory. For example, it can be
used to create a project only directory.</p>
<p>It is also possible to filter the Search Directory and get a filter url.</p>
<p><img src="../Images/omf-january-2018/GetFilterUrl.png" alt="Get Filter Url" /></p>
<p>If you use this url, the Site Directory can be accessed with a default filter.</p>

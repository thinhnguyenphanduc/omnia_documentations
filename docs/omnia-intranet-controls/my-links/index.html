<h1 id="my-links">My Links</h1>
<p>The My Links control makes it possible for the logged on user to have quick access to resources that are often used.</p>
<p>The control will display links that are mandatory, links that the user have selected from the centrally handled list, and personal links the user has created.</p>
<p>The My Links control is part of the Cross Site Header and is shown across all SharePoint sites in Omnia. My links can also be added separately to any legacy page as a web part or to a Quick Page as a block, to for example display the users last visited links.</p>
<p>Here's an example of My Links in the Cross Sites Header:</p>
<p><img src="../../Images/my-links-example.png" alt="My Links - No links added yet" /></p>

<li><strong>Filter links...</strong>: The list can be filtered by typing in the top field.</li>
<li><strong>Show all links</strong>: Select to show all centrally handled links.</li>
<li><strong>Show categories</strong>: Select to show category headings for the links. If not selected the list of links is shown in alphabetical order. If selected the list is shown, sorted on the category headings, in alphabetical order.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="my-links-mobile-navigation">My Links Mobile Navigation</h2>

The links list can not be altered through the web part/block. The my links web part/block settings are web part scoped.</p>

<h1 id="current-navigation">Current Navigation</h1>
<p>The current navigation control makes it possible for the end user to navigate to siblings, parent nodes and parent node siblings. The control is part of page layouts using left-hand-side navigation.</p>
<p><img src="../../Images/currentnavigation.png" alt="Current Navigation" /></p>
<p>The current navigation settings are page layout scoped. The settings are valid for a specific page layout within the current site collection.</p>
<p>The current navigation is responsive. In a certain width (optimized for mobile phones and tablets) the current navigation will be hidden. The mobile navigation will then be used instead.</p>
<h2 id="the-settings">The settings</h2>
<p>To change the settings for the control, activate the Edit switch and click the settings gear.</p>
<p>This will open the settings dialog.</p>

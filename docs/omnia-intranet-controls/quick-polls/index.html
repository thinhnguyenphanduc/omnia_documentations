<h1 id="quick-polls">Quick Polls</h1>
<p>Through the Quick Polls control a web editor can add a poll on a web page (the questions are created in Omnia Admin). Quick Polls can be added as a web part to any standard Sharepoint page and as a block to any Quick Page.</p>
<p>Here's an example on how an end users would see a Quick Poll:</p>
<p><img src="../../Images/quick-poll.png" alt="Quick Polls" /></p>
<p>Note! As usual you must publish the page for any changes to be shown for the users.</p>
<p>When a user has voted, the present result is shown, for example:</p>
<p><img src="../../Images/quick-poll-result.png" alt="Quick Poll result" /></p>
<p>Note! Whether a user has answered the poll or not is stored as a cookie in the web browser. If another web browser is used or the cookies are cleared, the user will be able to vote again.</p>
<h2 id="the-settings">The settings</h2>
<p>To access the settings for the control, activate the Edit option and click the settings gear for the control. This will open the settings dialog. Use the following settings:</p>

<h3 id="question">Question</h3>
<p>On this tab you select question.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question</strong> Open the list and select which Quick Poll to display.</li>
<li><strong>Display settings</strong> You should primarily set colors through Theme colors in Omnia Admin, but if needed you can set background color, link color and border color here or on the &quot;Custom colors&quot; tab.</li>
</ul>
<p>The selected poll must be available (start date and time, and end date and time), If it's not available, the message &quot;The selected poll is not active&quot; is shown. You then have to select another poll, or have a talk with the administrator to change start- or end time for the poll yopu would like to display.</p>
<h3 id="general">General</h3>
<p>On this tab you set the position for the explanation of the result (the Legend). You can also chosse &quot;None&quot; to not display the explanation.</p>
<p><img src="../../Images/quick-poll-General.png" alt="Quick Polls General tab" /></p>

<h3 id="targeting">Targeting</h3>
<p>If targeting is activated, you can select to use targeting for this poll.</p>
<p>Select &quot;Target to&quot; and choose target group in the list.</p>

<h1 id="important-announcements-administration">Important Announcements Administration</h1>
<p>The tenant feature &quot;Omnia Important Announcements&quot; needs to be activated in order for the Important Announcements administration page to appear. The administration page displays the history of all important announcements published in the tenant.</p>
<p><img src="../../Images/adminimportantannouncements1-new.png" alt="Important Announcements Overview" /></p>
<p>Global and tenant administrators can add new Important Announcements. If additional users should be able to create important announcements, add them using the &quot;Pemissions&quot; option. You can add users or permission groups.</p>
<p>To add a new Important Announcement, click the link &quot;Add Important Announcement&quot;.</p>

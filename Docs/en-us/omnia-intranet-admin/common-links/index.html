<h1 id="common-links">Common Links</h1>
<p>Common Links is a tenant scoped feature - the settings is used across all SharePoint sites in Omnia. It makes it possible to create a central list of links to resources that are commonly used within the organization.</p>
<p>Some links can be mandatory and it's also possible to target links to certain groups. Permissions to work with Common Links can be delegated to other colleagues.</p>
<p>The end user can access the common links in the <a href="/Docs/en-us/omnia-intranet-controls/my-links/index.html">My Links</a> control.</p>
<p>The list constains all active links. You can edit a link or delete it from here.</p>

<p>To create a link, click &quot;Add link&quot; and the following window is shown. The same window is shown when you edit a link.</p>
<p><img src="../../Images/common_links_new.png" alt="Add Common Link" /></p>
<p><strong>Title</strong> The title is shown as the clickable text, in My links.</p>
<p><strong>Url</strong> The link to go to when the user clicks the link.</p>
<p><strong>Category</strong> Links that are the same category will automatically be sorted together when the user chooses to display the categories.</p>
<p><strong>Information</strong> This field can be used for additional information about the link. If you enter something here, an information icon is shown next to the link, in My links. Users can click the icon to read the information. Not mandatory.</p>
<p><strong>Open in New Window</strong> Select to open in a new browser window. Normally a good idea for external links.</p>
<p><strong>Mandatory</strong> If selected, the link is always shown for all users (or the limited set of users), and can not be deselected.</p>
<p><strong>Icon</strong> An icon is always shown for a link. If you would like another icon for this link, select the &quot;Build in&quot; icon set or &quot;Custom&quot;, and the choose icon.</p>

<p>A link can be targeted to any receivers that has been defined in the Target Definition selected for Common Links. A targeted link is only available for selection by the target group. No one else will see the link. For more information on Targeting Definitions, see:</p>

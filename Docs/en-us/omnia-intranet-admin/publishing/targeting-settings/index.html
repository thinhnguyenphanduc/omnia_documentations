<h1 id="targeting-settings">Targeting Settings</h1>
<p>To be able to target news, you have to activate targeting for the web site News Center. It's then upp to the news editors to use targeting, or not, for a news page.</p>
<p>When you activate targeting you must also select a Target Definition to use. The Target Definition must be set up before you do. See this page for more information:</p>
<p><a href="/Docs/en-us/omnia-foundation-admin/targeting-definitions/index.html">Targeting Definitions</a></p>
<p>To enable targeting for a site, do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>See to that the correct site (News Center) is the actual site.</li>
<li>Click &quot;Targeting settings&quot;.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="../../../Images/page-targering-setting.png" alt="Targeting settings" /></p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Click &quot;Target to&quot; and select target definition to use (you can only use one).</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="../../../Images/page-target.png" alt="Targeting settings" /></p>
<p>When targeting is on for the news site, an editor can use the &quot;Targeting&quot; tab to select target group, if needed.</p>

<p>If targeting should have any effect in the News Viewer it has to be activated there as well. Do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Show the edit icons.</li>
<li>Click the icon (the cogwheel) for the control to open the settings.</li>
<li>Select &quot;Use targeting&quot;.</li>
</ol>

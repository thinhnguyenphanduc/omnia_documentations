<h1 id="layout-designer">Layout Designer</h1>
<p>An administrator or an editor with the correct permissions can work with Page Layouts. There are two levels which will normally need different permissions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Layout Designer: Normally used by an administrator, to create layouts to be used in the Page Designer.</li>
<li>Page Designer: Normally used by an administrator or an editor to place controls (blocks) in the layout. A block can for example be Page Contents, Related Links or a Banner.</li>
</ul>
<p>The prerequisite is that the page is a <strong>Quick Page</strong>.</p>
<p>You can't use this kind of Page Layout on a standard Sharepoint Page - a page where &quot;Enable legacy web parts&quot; is on.</p>
<p>Here we will describe the Layout Designer. For an instruction on how to use the Page Designer, see:</p>
<p><a href="/Docs/en-us/omnia-intranet-controls/page-designer/index.html">The Page Designer</a></p>
<p>Besides that, there are settings in Omnia Admin where an administrator can select the Page Layouts to be available for the active site collection, see:</p>
<p><a href="/Docs/en-us/omnia-intranet-admin/layouts/index.html">Layouts settings</a></p>

<li>Show Edit icons.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you have the correct permissions something like this will be shown:</p>
<p><img src="../../Images/layout-designer-1.png" alt="Layout Designer 1" /></p>
<ol>
<li>Click the &quot;Layout Designer&quot; icon (if it's not shown, you don't have the correct permissions).</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="../../Images/layout-designer-2.png" alt="Layout Designer 2" /></p>
<p>You can now select Page Layout for the page, edit the Page Layout or create a new Page Layout.</p>

</ol>
<p><img src="../../Images/select-page-layout-new.png" alt="Select Page Layout" /></p>
<p>If more than one Page Layout is available, you can change page layout for a page this way. You must publish to apply the layout change.</p>
<p>Note! If blocks already are added to the page, they will normally realign to the new layout. If that is not possible, all blocks will be placed in one single Zone. You then have to drag the blocks to the correct Zones.</p>
<h3 id="editing-a-page-layout">Editing a Page Layout</h3>
<p>To edit a Page Layout, do the following:</p>
<ol>

<p>Something like this is shown:</p>
<p><img src="../../Images/page-layout-new.png" alt="Edit Page Layout" /></p>
<p>You can now add, edit or delete Zones. You must publish to apply the changes.</p>
<p>When you edit an existing layout you can choose to save your edited layout as a new template, see below. You don't have to publish to be able to do that.</p>

<li>Click &quot;Save&quot;.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="../../Images/save-new-page-layout2.png" alt="Create a new Page Layout" /></p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Edit the new layout by adding, deleting or editing Zones.</li>
<li>Publish to apply the changes to the Page Layout.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note! When you publish, the selected page layout will be applied for the active page.</p>
<h3 id="edit-static-control-and-cascade-to-left">Edit static control and Cascade to left</h3>
<p>When you edit a layout there can be static controls, that can't be edited or moved by the editor. As default they are not shown. If you want to see where they are, click &quot;Edit static control&quot;.</p>
<p><img src="../../Images/static-and-cascade.png" alt="Edit static control and Cascade to left" /></p>
<p>When you add a new control, it is, per default, aligned (cascaded) to the left. If you don't want that, click &quot;Cascade to left&quot; to deselect that option.</p>
<h3 id="delete-undo-changes-and-publish">Delete, Undo Changes and Publish</h3>

<p>Add a new name for the layout and then click Save.</p>
<p><img src="../../Images/save-as-new-layout.png" alt="Save as new layout" /></p>
<p>You can continue working on the page, adding blocks and so fort, and publish when you are done.</p>
<h3 id="version-history-for-page-layouts">Version History for Page Layouts</h3>
<p>When you do any change to a Page Layout, a Version History node is created. You can use the Version History to go back to any earlier edition of the Page Layout.</p>
<p>Published editions are noted with an integer, work in progress with a decimal.</p>

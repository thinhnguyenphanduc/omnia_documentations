<h1 id="create-news-article">Create news article</h1>
<p>News articles can be created by any user that has permission to do so. How the permissions is set up may differ, but very often there is a separate permission group for News Authors.</p>
<p>Creating, editing and publishing a news article is very similar to working with a publishing page (a news article is in fact a page). See this description for general information on how to work with pages:</p>
<p><a href="/docs/en-us/introduction-to-content-management/index.html">Introduction to Content Management</a></p>
<p>Here we will have a look at what's different with a news article page.</p>
<p>The first step is to go to the news archive. If you can't find it, there's a link at the bottom of the news list.</p>
<p>If you are permitted to create news articles you will see the button &quot;Create News Article&quot;. If there are news article you have created, but not yet published, select &quot;Show My Drafts&quot; to see them.</p>

<p>The name of the news page will also be suggested as the title, but can be edited.</p>
<p><img src="../../Images/createnews2.png" alt="Create News Article" /></p>
<p>Note: the tabs &quot;General&quot;, &quot;Contents&quot; and &quot;Links&quot; works exactly the same for news pages as for publishing pages. The Properties tab is normally somewhat different:</p>
<p><img src="../../Images/createnewsprop.png" alt="Create News Article" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Contact</strong> Add the name of the contact person, that should be displayed on the news article page. It is displayed at the top of the page, if a page image is inserted, directly under the image.</li>
<li><strong>Article Date</strong> Article date is relevant for sorting in the news lists. Publication of a news article is always done directly, regardless of what article date is set.</li>
<li><strong>Enterprise Keywords</strong> Add keywords here, if applicable. Keywords is important for the Related News list. Other news articles tagged with the same keywords as the current article is shown in that list.</li>
<li><strong>Organization</strong> and <strong>Location</strong> THese two fields are examples of metadata fields, that could be used for example for filtering in various lists. What fields will be available, if any, for this purpose, depends on how the News Center is set up.</li>
<li><strong>Top Story</strong> Select if the news article should be displayed as a top story.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="targeting-news">Targeting news</h2>
<p>Targeting will decide what users will see in the news list, and as a top story, on the start page. It has no effect in the news archive. All users can always read all news there, and will find them through search.</p>
<p>You never have to use targering, it's something you as a news editor can use when needed.</p>
<p>For an editor to be able to target the news, the following is required (done by an administrator):</p>
<ul>
<li>The Targeting Definition that should be used for news must be set up in &quot;Targeting Definition&quot; in Omnia Admin.</li>
<li>Targeting must be activated for the web site News Center, and the correct Tareting Definition selected when doing that That setting is found under &quot;Content Management&quot; in Omnia Admin.</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information about Targeting Definitions, see:</p>
<p><a href="/Docs/en-us/omnia-foundation-admin/targeting-definitions/index.html">Targeting definitions</a></p>
<p>For more information about Content Management settings, see:</p>
<p><a href="/Docs/en-us/omnia-intranet-admin/publishing/index.html">Content Management settings</a></p>
<p>Here's how to target a news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create the news page as described above.</li>
<li>Click the tab &quot;Targeting&quot;.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="../../Images/targeting-news.png" alt="Targeting" /></p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Select &quot;Target to&quot;.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="../../Images/target-to-news.png" alt="Target to" /></p>
<p>When that is done there will be either a drop down list to select a group from, or one or more fields to select terms from, for example:</p>
<p><img src="../../Images/target-news.png" alt="Target to list" /></p>
<h2 id="scheduling-news">Scheduling news</h2>
<p>If Scheduling is activated for the News Site, a &quot;Scheduled&quot; tab is shown:</p>
<p><img src="../../Images/schedule-news.png" alt="Schedule news" /></p>
<p>Click to enable Scheduled publishing for the news page and set start date and time and, if you wish, end date and time. If you don't set end date and time, the news page is displayed a number od dayes according to the default news settings.</p>
<p><img src="../../Images/schedule-news-2.png" alt="Scheduled news" /></p>
<p>When you select to activate scheduled publishing for a news page the Publish button is deactivated. You just save the page the normal way. The page then is automaticelly published the start date and time you have set.</p>
